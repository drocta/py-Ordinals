# py-Ordinals
Handles Hessenberg natural addition, multiplication, and compairison of ordinal numbers less than epsilon_0. Uses Cantor Normal Form. 

To use, just import ordinals, and use w from it.
If you grab w from the ordinals file, whatever arithmetic you want to do based on that should work.

from ordinals import Ordinal, w
should do the trick. Then you can do whatever you want with w (which stands for omega) , whether it be adding, multiplying, raising to powers, comparing, casting to string, or what have you.

This is an early version, so it does not support ordinals greater than or equal to epsilon_0 , and it may have bugs.
I don't know of any bugs in it yet though, and it seems to work pretty well.

I hope this can be of use to someone.

If the license is a problem for you, please ask, and I'll try to see if we can work something out. However, I don't anticipate it being a problem, if I understand the license correctly.

Issues, pull requests, etc. are welcome.
